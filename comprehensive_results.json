Response B, in contrast, provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation that: (1) correctly identifies machine learning as a subset of artificial intelligence, (2) explains the core concept of automatic learning and improvement from experience, (3) clarifies that it doesn't require explicit programming for each task, (4) mentions the focus on developing computer programs, and (5) explains how these systems access and use data to learn.
