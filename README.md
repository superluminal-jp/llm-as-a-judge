# LLM-as-a-Judge System

A minimal implementation of an LLM-as-a-Judge system for evaluating language model outputs, based on the [Evidently AI guide](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge).

## Quick Start

```bash
python llm_judge_simple.py
```

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Working Minimal Implementation (`llm_judge_simple.py`)
- ✅ Direct scoring evaluation (1-5 scale) with structured reasoning
- ✅ Pairwise comparison (A vs B vs tie) with dimensional analysis
- ✅ Mock LLM integration for development and testing
- ✅ Command-line demo interface with examples
- ✅ Comprehensive planning documentation across all architectural levels

🟡 **Phase 2 In Progress**: Production-Ready Foundation
- 🟡 Real LLM API integration (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude)
- ⏳ Robust error handling and retry logic with circuit breakers
- ⏳ Configuration management with hierarchical loading
- ⏳ Async processing architecture for performance
- ⏳ Professional CLI interface with progress tracking

## Implementation Documentation

### 📋 Layered Planning Strategy

Following the AI Coding Agent Governance Framework, we maintain sophisticated documentation across multiple abstraction levels:

| Document | Abstraction Level | Purpose | Primary Audience |
|----------|-------------------|---------|------------------|
| [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) | **Strategic** | Business vision, market analysis, success metrics | C-Suite, Product Strategy, Investors |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | **Architectural** | System design, component relationships, scalability | Solution Architects, Technical Leadership |
| [DOMAIN-MODEL.md](DOMAIN-MODEL.md) | **Domain** | Business concepts, ubiquitous language, domain rules | Domain Experts, Senior Developers |
| [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) | **Implementation** | Detailed technical execution with acceptance criteria | Development Teams, DevOps Engineers |
| [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) | **Task** | Current sprint breakdown with validation gates | Individual Developers, Scrum Masters |
| [CODE_PLAN.md](CODE_PLAN.md) | **Code** | Specific code structure and implementation examples | Junior/Mid-level Developers |

## Key Features

### Evaluation Methods
- **Direct Scoring**: Rate responses on 1-5 scale with reasoning
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Compare two responses (A vs B vs tie)
- **Reference-Based**: Compare against golden examples *(planned)*

### LLM Provider Support
- **Current**: Mock integration for testing
- **Planned**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Local models

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Current**: Single criteria (e.g., "overall quality")
- **Planned**: Multi-dimensional evaluation, custom criteria

## Usage Examples

### Current Simple Usage
```python
from llm_judge_simple import LLMJudge, CandidateResponse

judge = LLMJudge()

# Single evaluation
candidate = CandidateResponse(
    prompt="What is AI?",
    response="AI is artificial intelligence",
    model="gpt-3.5"
)

result = judge.evaluate_response(candidate, "accuracy and clarity")
print(f"Score: {result.score}/5")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")
```

### Planned Enhanced Usage
```python
# Real LLM integration (Phase 2)
judge = EnhancedLLMJudge(provider="openai", api_key="sk-...")

# Async evaluation
result = await judge.evaluate_response_async(candidate)

# Batch processing (Phase 3)
results = await judge.evaluate_batch(candidates)

# API integration (Phase 3)
POST /evaluate
{
  "prompt": "What is AI?",
  "response": "AI is artificial intelligence",
  "criteria": "accuracy and clarity"
}
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Optional: OpenAI or Anthropic API keys for real LLM integration

### Installation
```bash
# Current minimal version
# No installation needed - single file

# Future modular version (Phase 2+)
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Testing
```bash
# Current
python llm_judge_simple.py

# Future
pytest tests/
```

## Contributing

This project follows a structured development approach:

1. **Start with documentation**: Review planning docs before coding
2. **Follow phases**: Complete Phase 1 before starting Phase 2
3. **Test-driven**: Write tests before implementation
4. **Incremental**: Small, working increments with rollback capability

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Timeline | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | ✅ Complete | Working minimal implementation |
| Phase 2 | 2-4 weeks | Production-ready core with real LLM integration |
| Phase 3 | 6-8 weeks | Advanced features and API |
| Phase 4 | 3-6 months | Enterprise-scale deployment |
