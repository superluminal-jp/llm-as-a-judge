{"type": "single", "prompt": "What is artificial intelligence?", "response": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It includes technologies like machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision that enable machines to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence such as reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.", "model": "advanced-model", "criteria": "comprehensive analysis"}
{"type": "comparison", "prompt": "Explain machine learning", "response_a": "ML is AI", "response_b": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.", "model_a": "basic-model", "model_b": "advanced-model"}
{"type": "single", "prompt": "What are the benefits of renewable energy?", "response": "Renewable energy offers numerous benefits including environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, economic advantages through job creation and energy independence, and long-term cost savings as technology improves and fossil fuel prices fluctuate.", "model": "sustainability-expert"}
